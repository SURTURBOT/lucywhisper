[![Open Source Love svg1](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

## Usage

### Deploy to Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/surturbot/lucywhisper)

1. Tap on above button and fill `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `BOT_TOKEN`.
2. Then tap "Deploy App" below it. Wait till deploying is complete (will take atmost 2 minutes).
3. After deploying is complete, tap on "Manage App"
4. Check the logs to see if your bot is ready!
5) **IMPORTANT** : You need to do two things on [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
   1) Turn on Inline Mode in your bot settings.
   2) Now go back to settings, Tap on `Inline Feedback` and then on `100%` (without this your bot is nothing.)
